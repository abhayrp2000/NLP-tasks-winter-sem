    "elon_musk='''Visionary engineer and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk is best known as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of electric car manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), and as the founder and CEO of aerospace manufacturer SpaceX. This article explores Musk’s journey towards achieving success as one of the world’s top businessmen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Life and Education\n",
    "Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk exhibited an active entrepreneurial spirit from an early age. He received tremendous support from his engineer father and his dietitian mother, who recognized their son's penchant for technology and nurtured his passion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Musk bought his first computer at age 10 and taught himself how to write programming code. And at the tender age of 12, the youngster built a fully functioning video game called Blastar, which he reportedly sold for $500.\n",
    "\n",
    "After graduating from Pretoria Boys High School in 1988, Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria for five months. He then moved to Canada, where he entered Queen's University in Ontario in 1889, enabling him to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service. Musk later attended the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics. He was later accepted into the physics graduate program at Stanford University, but dropped out after two days, to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success Story\n",
    "In 1995, Musk teamed up with his brother Kimbal to create Zip2, an IT company that licensed online city guide software to newspapers. Although the company struggled to gain traction in its first few years, local and national newspapers eventually began using Zip2 to offer additional services to their respective customers. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq’s AltaVista web search engine for a whopping $340 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "With business partners Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, Musk then launched X.com, an online financial services and email payment company. In 2000, X.com merged with American software company Confinity, best known for creating PayPal. In 2001, Musk was named Paypal’s chairman and CEO, shortly before that company was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion. As a stockholder with roughly $180 million worth of shares, Musk finally had enough capital to leave internet businesses behind, and channel his energies towards engineering concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla and Beyond\n",
    "In 2004, Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, to help run Tesla Motors, where Musk was integral in designing the first electric car: the Tesla Roadster. After Eberhard was ousted from the firm in 2007, following a series of disagreements, Musk seized management control as CEO and product architect. Under his watch, Tesla has become one of the world's most popular and coveted car brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "With his space travel company SpaceX, Musk landed several high-profile contracts with NASA and the United States Air Force, to design rockets and conduct military missions. Musk has been vocal about his plans to send an astronaut to Mars by the year 2025, in a collaborative effort with NASA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Net Worth and Current Influence\n",
    "The majority of Musk's $20.8 billion net worth is tied up in Tesla stock, of which he owns more than 33 million shares. In January 2018, Tesla, which is valued at roughly $11.6 billion, announced a compensation structure where Musk will not receive an annual salary, but will instead earn cash based on the increasing market caps the company hopes to achieve over the next ten years. The deal aims to assure shareholders and customers alike, that Musk plans to remain embedded with the company over the long haul.'''"

He is now officially the richest man in China with an estimated net worth of $25 Billion, on the back of the recent world record $150 Billion IPO filing of his company. Given all of this, Jack Ma only holds a 7.8% stake in Alibaba and a 50% stake in Alipay. Alibaba and Jack Ma, although are not household names out of China, you must know that Alibaba is worth more than Facebook, and processes goods more than eBay and Amazon combined!\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be beginning to seem like the story of an arrogant and rich billionaire who hasn’t seen the dark. But don’t be mistaken by the numbers that you see above, they can fool anyone. Although as simple as it may sound, Jack Ma has had it hard in his life to get to where he is today. A true rags-to-riches story and definitely a one which will inspire you even in your darkest days.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack Ma – The Backstory\n",
    "Jack Ma ChildhoodMa Yun a.k.a. Jack Ma is one of those self-made billionaires with humble beginnings. Jack Ma was born in Hangzhou, located in the south-eastern part of China. He was born and raised along with an elder brother and a younger sister during the rise of communist China and its isolation from the Western regions. His parents were traditional Musicians-Storytellers and they didn’t make enough to be even considered as middle class during those days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Former US president Richard Nixon’s visit to Hangzhou in 1972 improved the situation of tourism in his home-town and Jack wanted to make the most of this opportunity. Jack always wanted to learn English as a kid and he spent his early mornings riding on his bike to a nearby park, giving English tours to foreigners for free. It was then he met a foreign girl who gave him the nickname ‘Jack’ for his name was hard to spell for her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack, after graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in English, worked as an English teacher at Hangzhou Dianzi University with a pay of $12 a month! Now here comes the part where it gets more interesting, even before he has received that degree and became an English teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejected, But Not a Failure.\n",
    "Jack Ma Quote\n",
    "Jack Ma as an extremely lucky bloke who just became a billionaire in a snap. But it is safe to know that Rejections are synonymous with Jack Ma. You wouldn’t believe the number of times this man has been rejected and failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his early childhood, Jack Ma Failed in his Primary School examinations, not once, but Twice!  He Failed Thrice during his Middle School exams. When applying to universities after his High school, Jack failed the entrance exams thrice, before finally joining Hangzhou Normal University. He even applied and wrote to Harvard University ten times about being admitted – and got rejected each time. This was only during his education!\n",
    "\n",
    "During and after his Bachelor’s degree Jack tried and failed to get a job at a multitude of places. After spending three years to get into a University, Jack failed to land a job after applying to them 30 times! He recollects in his interview, “When KFC came to China, 24 people went for the job.  Twenty-three people were accepted.  I was the only guy who wasn’t.” He also one of the 5 applicants to a job in Police force and was the only one getting rejected after being told, “No, you’re no good.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, on his Entrepreneurial undertakings, Jack Ma went on to fail on two of his initial ventures. But that didn’t stop him in any way of dreaming bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Down, but not Out!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Resurrection of Jack Ma\n",
    "Jack Ma at Alibaba IPO\n",
    "In one of his interviews, when asked about his rejections, this is what he had to say, “Well, I think we have to get used to it.  We’re not that good.” Overcoming the pain of rejections and treating rejections as opportunities to learn and grow was what Jack Ma made of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finally coming to terms with all of his rejections and failures, Jack Ma visited US in 1995, for a Government undertaking project related to the building of highways. It was then that Jack Ma was first introduced to the Internet and Computers. Computers were pretty rare in China then, given the high costs associated with them and Internet or E-mails were non-existent. The first word he searched on the Mosaic browser was ‘Beer’, and it popped out results from different countries, but signs of China anywhere. He then searched ‘China’ and not a single result popped out! He decided it was time for China and its people to get on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after persuading 17 of his other friends to invest and join him in his new e-commerce startup – Alibaba, the company began from his apartment. Initially, Alibaba didn’t had a single penny in investment from outside investors, but they later raised $20 Million from SoftBank and another $5 Million from Goldman Sachs in 1999. Building trust among the people of China that an online system of payment and package transfers is safe was the biggest challenge Jack Ma and Alibaba faced, a challenge that Jack will cherish for his lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having started his first successful company at the age of 31 and even after never having written a single line of code or selling something to anyone, Jack Ma runs one of the biggest E-commerce networks in the world. The company went on to grow rapidly, expanding all across the world, quickly growing out of its China shell. Only second to Walmart now in terms of sales per year, Alibaba has become the E-commerce giant that Jack Ma has envisioned for it.'''"
